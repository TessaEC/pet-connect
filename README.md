# Pet Connect

Just two struggling Web Developers trying to help pets find their Fur-ever Home!

Our mission is to create a pet adoption website that serves as a centralized platform for shelters to post and showcase their available pets. We believe in connecting shelters with potential pet adopters, making the adoption process more accessible, efficient, and successful. By providing a common area for shelters to showcase their pets, we aim to increase the visibility of available pets, promote responsible pet ownership, and ultimately find loving homes for every animal in need. We are committed to making a positive impact on the lives of both pets and humans by facilitating meaningful connections and promoting the joy of pet adoption.
