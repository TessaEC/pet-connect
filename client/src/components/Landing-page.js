      <h2>Welcome to Pet-Connect!</h2>
      <p>Just two struggling Web Developers trying to help pets find their Fur-ever Home!</p>
      <p>Our mission is to create a pet adoption website that serves as a centralized platform for 
        shelters to post and showcase their available pets. We believe in connecting shelters with potential pet adopters, 
        making the adoption process more accessible, efficient, and successful. By providing a common area for shelters to 
        showcase their pets, we aim to increase the visibility of available pets, promote responsible pet ownership, and 
        ultimately find loving homes for every animal in need. We are committed to making a positive impact on the lives of 
        both pets and humans by facilitating meaningful connections and promoting the joy of pet adoption.</p>

        <p>Don't forget to click that Donate button below! Every dollar counts and is distributed to all of our animal shelters in need.
          Your money goes straight into the pets pockets! Donations provide shelter, nourishment, medical care, and endless tail wags!</p>
